GitHub pages is a cool thing. It allowed me to get my personal website up and running in a few hours using Jekyll.

I can write Markdown here at it will look cool. Code snippets look really nice:

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np

def do_something(np_array):
    return np_array * 2
{% endhighlight %}

I look forward to populating this website with technical blog posts and information about my personal projects.
